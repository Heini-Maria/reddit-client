# Diddit  = Reddit Client for sewing & Crafts subreddits

This project was made in a part of CodeCademy's Front-end engineer carreer path. The purpose was to create a minimalistic Reddit Client using React and Redux. Because of my love to DIY projects, I decided to devote the client for Sewing and Crafts subreddits. For making the application more visual I decided to only show the posts that has picture.

The application allows the user to view the posts of two subreddits, search posts within the subreddit with a searchterm and see stats and main comments of each post. 

Visit the deployed application here: https://cosmic-kringle-9deec8.netlify.app

## Wireframes

Here are wireframes I planned for different screen sizes:

## Technologies used

  * React
  * Redux
  * Redux Toolkit
    
## Features

  * Shows posts for crafts and Sewing categories
  * Updates the feed based on selected gategory
  * Allows user to seach for posts in selected category with a search term
  * Shows the main comments and stats for each post
  * Allows the user to view the original Post on Reddit

### Limitations

  * For now the application doesn't show the comment replies, only the original comments
  * user can't comment or give votes directly in the application

## Future work

  * Fetch the comment replies as a part of the comments view
  * Show the comment authors profile picture on comments view
  * Refactore the code to make testing easier
  * write tests for components
  
## Personal experience 

At the beginning I was overwhelmed and was not even familiar with Reddit and how it works. After getting some inspiration and getting more familiar with the Reddit, I decided to take one step at a time and found the flow. At the end the project thought me alot and help me to get more comfortable using React and Redux. The project itself was super rewarding and eventhough I am not 100% happy with the code I pulled it through. If I would start the project from start again I would structure the code differently and divide the components and actions in smaller functions that would be easier to test. 

well live & learn ☺️

Any feedback is higly appreciated.
