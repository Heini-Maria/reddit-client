# Diddit = Reddit Client for sewing & Crafts subreddits

This project was made as a part of Codecademy's Front-end engineer career path. The purpose was to create a minimalistic Reddit Client using React and Redux. Because of my love for DIY projects, I decided to devote the client to Sewing and Crafts subreddits. For making the application more visual I decided to only show the posts that have pictures.

The application allows the user to view the posts of two subreddits, search posts within the subreddit with a search term and see stats and main comments of each post.

## Wireframes

Here are the wireframes I planned for different screen sizes:

## Technologies used

- React
- Redux
- Redux Toolkit
- Jest & RTL

## Features

- Shows posts for crafts and Sewing categories
- Updates the feed based on the selected category
- Allows the user to search for posts in the selected category with a search term
- Shows the main comments and stats for each post
- Allows the user to view the original Post on Reddit

### Limitations

- For now, the application doesn't show the comment replies, only the original comments
- user can't comment or give votes directly in the application

## Future work

- Fetch the comment replies as a part of the comments view
- Show the comment author's profile picture on the comment's view
- Refactor the code to make testing easier
- write tests for each relevant component

## Personal experience

In the beginning, I was overwhelmed and was not even familiar with Reddit and how it works. After getting some inspiration and getting more familiar with Reddit, I decided to take one step at a time and found the flow. In the end, the project thought me a lot and help me to get more comfortable using React and Redux. The project itself was super rewarding and even though I am not 100% happy with the code I pulled it through. If I would start the project from start again I would structure the code differently and divide the components and actions into smaller functions that would be easier to test.

well live & learn ☺️

Any feedback is highly appreciated.
